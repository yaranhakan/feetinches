Feet Inches Assignment


Hello World!

This is my first GitHub repository.

This file was my college assignment of "Introduction to Computer Science II in C++" course.

The professor asked students to change the class "FeetInches" by decreasing 
the variable count from 2 to 1 while keeping the inputs and outputs of the class same.
